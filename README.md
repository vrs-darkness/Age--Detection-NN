# Age--Detection-NN
->This Notebook is for the Age Detection based on the input image.\n

->It gives 3 classes as output { Young ,  Mid , Old } 
->Here there will be Three layers namely the Input, the Hidden Layer and Output Layer
->The activation Function that is used in any layer is Sigmoid Function.
->Also I have Included the data set for this Neural Network I was able to get only correct format training data , Testing data was without ground truth so i just found my NN accuuracy using 10 images.
